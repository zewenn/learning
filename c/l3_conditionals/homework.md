# Homework!

Write a program that reads from the arguments. If the first (`argv[1]`) argument is `"pig"`, write out something about pigs on the screen, otherwise just tell the user you don't know that animal.
*NOTE: always check for argument count!*

> **[BONUS TASK]** Add two more animals to the code, and use never nesting.
